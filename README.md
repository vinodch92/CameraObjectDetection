# CameraObjectDetection
This is an example project for Real Time Camera Object Detection with Machine Learning.This example code describes the way that how to detect an object using device camera in real time. In this app ResNet50 pre-trained apple model is used.

# ResNet50 Model:-
Detects the dominant objects present in an image from a set of 1000 categories such as trees, animals, food, vehicles, people, and more. You can find this model here https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/

# Steps to run this project:-
1.Clone or Download the project. <br/>
2.ResNet50 file is missing. So you can download the model file from https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/ .<br/>
3.Add the model to your project and be sure that target is set. <br/>
4.Run the project. <br/>

# Please Note: - You must include the ResNet50 model file to compile the project
